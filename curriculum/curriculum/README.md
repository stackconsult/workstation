# Workstation Browser-Agent Curriculum

This six-module curriculum transforms an empty GitHub repository into a production-grade browser-agent system with orchestration, authentication, and client-ready packaging. Each module builds on concrete artifacts from the previous one, ensuring a hands-on, incremental learning experience.

## How to use this curriculum

This curriculum is designed to be followed **in order**, from Module 1 through Module 6, because each module builds on concrete artifacts created in the previous one (environment, architecture, agents, automations, and offers).  

Plan to treat each module as a self-contained "work block": read the short overview, complete the hands-on tasks, and finish the checklist at the end before moving on. You should have a working environment and a visible change in your Workstation repo at the end of every module.  

If you already have parts of the stack in place (for example, a running backend or existing agents), you can skim the relevant sections but should still complete the validation steps so the rest of the course stays aligned with your setup.

## Overall learning objectives

By the end of this curriculum, you will be able to:

- Take an empty or fresh GitHub repository and stand up a production-grade Workstation backend with browser agents, orchestration, and CI in place.  
- Build, run, and debug a Chrome extension that talks to your backend through well-defined HTTP and auth contracts.  
- Design, register, and safely extend agents for data, integrations, and storage, using a consistent registry and workflow model.  
- Automate common workflows through scheduled or triggered runs and observe them with basic monitoring and logs.  
- Package the Workstation and its agents into clear client offers and internal platform services with pricing, SLAs, and rollout playbooks.
