updates:
  # PRODUCTION DEPENDENCIES ONLY - Root package.json
  # This configuration ONLY monitors the root /package.json
  # It does NOT scan subdirectories (agents/, mcp-containers/, modules/, tools/, examples/, tests/)
  # The 'allow' directive restricts to production dependencies only
  # Development dependencies group is preserved but won't create PRs due to 'allow' restriction
  # This monitors ONLY the main package.json at the repository root
  # By specifying directory: "/" without additional entries, Dependabot will:
  # 1. Only check /package.json (the root file)
  # 2. Ignore all subdirectory package.json files
  #    (agents/, mcp-containers/, modules/, tools/, etc.)
  #
  # Rationale: Subdirectories contain test code, examples, and experimental
  # agents that should not trigger dependency update PRs. Only production
  # code matters.
